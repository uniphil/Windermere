Our work has shown that although seemingly complex these stratal units consist of a recurring succession of a small number of different channel types, each with a unique internal stratigraphy.  Further, it is proposed that these different channel types are a reflection of systematic changes in the formative through-going channel flows, specifically changes in flow volume, degree of vertical density stratification, and very importantly, grain size distribution.",

Quanstrom  although they are sandstones they weather like a mudstone (consequence of their high (30-50%) matrix content), and have a distinctive green colour (due to the occurrence of authigenic chlorite (alteration of primary clay minerals)).  In most cases these strata form a few to several bed sliver generally at the base of a much thicker succession of sandstone (splay, distributary channel, slope channel etc.).  Although individual beds have been captured and described in the countless number of individual strata logs measured in both study areas, it was always the unit (i.e. bed set) that was traced laterally with little attention paid to its internal stratigraphy.  \n\nThis poster illustrates the results of a detailed analysis of a single matrix-rich sandstone unit  6 m thick and almost 1 km wide.  Of note is that in many ways, but importantly very different in others, our structureless, matrix-rich sandstones resemble matrix-rich strata previously termed linked debrites, slurry beds, transitional flows, etc.  However based on stratigraphic associations and internal facies architecture, and its variation laterally, the origin of our matrix-rich sandstones bear little resemblance to that proposed for other matrix-rich sandstones.  In our experience (and interpretation) the matrix-rich sandstones described here do NOT mark the distal fringe or ~low-energy part of a depositional system, but instead represent its abrupt, energetic initiation  these are harbinger beds!

Mikes work shows that although this effect is indeed observed, the effect is far less dramatic than previously imagined, and by no means restricted to the region below the velocity core (i.e. in the lower part of the flow).  Results show that turbulence is a full-flow-depth phenomenon and that for a single sediment concentration becomes increasingly damped in progressively finer-grained suspensions  in other words, its more a function of the number of particles in suspension compared to their total suspended volume or mass concentration.  This, then, suggests that turbidity currents with similar sediment concentration (by mass, or similarly volume) but different grain size distributions, will exhibit very different sediment transport and depositional characteristics.
